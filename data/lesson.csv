24,Technology for X-Informatics: K-means (Python Track),1,K-means in Python,,,assets/slides/Lecture_16_1.pdf,I79ISV6XBbE,<p>Geoffrey uses the K-means Python code in SciPy package to show real code for clustering and applies it a set of 85 two dimensional vectors -- officially sets of weights and heights to be clustered to find T-shirt sizes. We run through Python code with Matplotlib displays to divide into 2-5 clusters. Then we discuss Python to generate 4 clusters of varying sizes and centered at corners of a square in two dimensions. We formally give the K means algorithm better than before and make definition consistent with code in SciPy</p>,

We allow this number of independent runs to be changed and in particular set to 1 to generate more interesting erratic results. We define changes in our new K means code that also has two measures of quality allowed. The slides give many results of clustering into 2 4 6 and 8 clusters (there were only 4 real clusters). We show that the ''very small'' case has two very different solutions when clustered into two clusters and use this to discuss functions with multiple minima and a hill between them.
